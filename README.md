# AtliQ Grands Business Intelligence Project

## Project Overview
AtliQ Grands, a renowned chain of five-star hotels across India, has been a key player in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. However, due to increasing competition and ineffective management decisions, the company has been facing a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel segment.

To counteract these challenges, the Managing Director of AtliQ Grands has decided to integrate "Business and Data Intelligence" into their operations. Since they lack an in-house data analytics team, they have outsourced this task to a third-party service provider for generating actionable insights from their historical data.

## Task Overview
As a data analyst, you are provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard. Your tasks include:
1. **Creating the necessary metrics** as per the predefined metric list.
2. **Developing a dashboard** based on the stakeholder-provided mock-up.
3. **Deriving additional insights** beyond those specified in the metric list or mock-up dashboard.

## Project Deliverables
- **Metrics Calculation:** Implementing key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess revenue trends, occupancy rates, customer retention, and other relevant metrics.
- **Dashboard Development:** Designing a user-friendly dashboard that effectively visualizes insights for AtliQ Grands' revenue management team.
- **Additional Insights:** Identifying and presenting data-driven opportunities for revenue growth, customer segmentation, pricing strategies, and operational improvements.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Data Processing:** Excel, SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization:** Tableau, Power BI
- **Insights & Reporting:** Jupyter Notebook, PowerPoint, or a report document

## Expected Outcomes
- A structured **dashboard** with clear and interactive visualizations
